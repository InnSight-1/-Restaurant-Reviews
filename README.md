# Restaurant-Reviews

The Restaurant Reviews application allows a user to provide and look up reviews for different restaurants. This would help people to give their opinion, and it will help others at the time of choosing a restaurant to visit. Users can see the basic information of a restaurant and the average rating for each restaurant from all the reviews available. Also, it is possible to sort the restaurants according to their average ratings and names. A person can also search a particular restaurant by its name, zip code, or state. Restaurant and review records can all be edited or deleted.
